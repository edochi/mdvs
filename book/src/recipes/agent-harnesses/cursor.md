# Cursor

> **Schema-correct but not smoke-tested end-to-end by us.** The install commands produce output that matches [Cursor's hooks reference](https://cursor.com/docs/hooks) — the flat matcher entry shape, the top-level `"version": 1` field, the snake-case `additional_context` in the runtime envelope. The full feedback loop has not been verified by us in a live Cursor session. If you wire mdvs into Cursor and hit a wiring bug, please [open an issue](https://github.com/edochi/mdvs/issues).

For the design intent behind the integration and the runtime story, see the [Agent harnesses overview](../agent-harnesses.md). For copy-paste install steps, read on.

## Install

```bash
mkdir -p .cursor/skills/mdvs .cursor/rules
mdvs scaffold skill > .cursor/skills/mdvs/SKILL.md
mdvs scaffold snippet --platform cursor > .cursor/rules/mdvs.mdc
mdvs scaffold hook --platform cursor >> .cursor/hooks.json
```

Note the snippet uses `>` not `>>` — the Cursor variant is a `.mdc` file with YAML frontmatter at the top (`alwaysApply: true`), so it stands alone in `.cursor/rules/`, not appended to a larger file.

If `.cursor/hooks.json` already exists, **merge by hand**: the snippet emits a complete top-level object with `version: 1` and the `hooks.postToolUse` array; you'll need to union the array contents with anything you already have.

## What you get

- **Skill**: agent learns when to call which mdvs command, how to interpret violations, and the schema-evolution loop. Cursor reads skills from `.cursor/skills/`, `.agents/skills/`, `.claude/skills/`, and `.codex/skills/` — we use `.cursor/skills/` as the native path.
- **Snippet**: `.cursor/rules/mdvs.mdc` with `alwaysApply: true`. Cursor includes it in every conversation automatically.
- **Validate hook**: after every `Edit` / `Write` / `MultiEdit` on a markdown file inside an mdvs vault, `mdvs hook handle` runs `check` and surfaces violations through Cursor's `additional_context` field. Always exits 0.
- **Search-nudge hook**: same pattern, matching Bash search-tool invocations.

## Per-platform notes

- **Hook envelope shape is different from Claude Code / Codex.** Cursor uses snake-case `additional_context` at the top level, no `hookSpecificOutput` wrapper. The `mdvs hook handle` runtime emits this shape automatically when called with `--platform cursor` — the per-platform JSON shape lives in `cursor/platform.toml`'s envelope template.
- **No user-visible channel.** Cursor's `postToolUse` only has an agent-context field (`additional_context`); there's no equivalent of Claude Code's `systemMessage`. Validation violations reach the agent but not the user UI directly. (Cursor has `user_message` for the permission/deny flow, but that's separate.)
- **Config shape is different too.** Cursor's `hooks.json` uses flat matcher entries (`{ matcher, command }`) — no nested `hooks` array — and includes a top-level `"version": 1` field. The emitted JSON snippet captures this.
- **Project rules**: Cursor also honors `AGENTS.md` at workspace root. If you'd rather paste the universal snippet there: `mdvs scaffold snippet >> AGENTS.md` (without `--platform`).
- **mdvs on PATH**: the hook command is `mdvs hook handle --platform cursor --kind <kind>`. `mdvs` must be available to Cursor's hook subprocess. On macOS, Cursor launched from Spotlight may not see your shell PATH — symlink `mdvs` into `/usr/local/bin/` or install via `cargo install --path crates/mdvs`.
