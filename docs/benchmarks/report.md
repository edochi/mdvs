# mdvs vs QMD — benchmark report

_Generated 2026-05-27 23:26_

_mdvs 0.6.2 · QMD 2.5.2_

This report characterises how mdvs and QMD compare on warm/steady-state search latency, peak memory, build time, and output footprint. See [TODO-0166](../spec/todos/TODO-0166.md) for the framing and decisions behind what's measured (and what's deliberately not).

## Methodology

For each (tool, corpus, query) combination the runner records:

- **Warm/steady-state search latency** — `/usr/bin/time -l` wall time, median of N iterations after one warm-up invocation
- **Peak resident set size** — maximum RSS observed during the query
- **CPU%** — derived from `(user + sys) / wall × 100`; indicates whether wall time was CPU-bound or I/O-bound
- **Index build time** — single timed run from clean state (`rm -rf .mdvs && mdvs build --force` for mdvs; `qmd collection add` + `qmd embed -f` for QMD)
- **Index size on disk** — `du -sk` after build
- **Output token count** — `tiktoken` cl100k_base over the result snippets, for `--limit 10`
- **Tool footprint on disk** — binary + cached embedding/reranker models

Cold-start latency and page-fault counts are deliberately excluded; see [TODO-0166](../spec/todos/TODO-0166.md) for the rationale.

Each search runs three iterations preceded by one warm-up invocation, so the reported wall time and RSS reflect steady-state behaviour.

## Reading the numbers fairly

The two tools have meaningfully different feature sets. Any conclusions drawn from these numbers should respect the following:

- **QMD `query` runs LLM reranking and query expansion** on top of BM25 + vector. mdvs's hybrid mode uses RRF only — no LLM in the loop. The reranking step changes both latency and quality; comparing wall times alone understates QMD's quality work
- **QMD does AST-aware chunking** for source code (TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, Go, Rust); mdvs uses prose chunking via `text-splitter`'s `MarkdownSplitter`. On code-heavy corpora the chunking strategies will produce different recall/precision profiles, independent of search engine speed
- **mdvs has `--where` SQL filtering and frontmatter validation**; QMD has neither. These are feature presence, not performance, and don't appear in the metric tables
- **Embedding models differ in size and quality.** mdvs uses Model2Vec `potion-base-8M` (~30 MB static distillation); QMD uses `embeddinggemma-300M-Q8_0` (~300 MB GGUF). Smaller model → less memory and faster load, but a different quality ceiling
- **Default chunking and limits differ.** mdvs uses 1024-char chunks; QMD's default chunking produces roughly one chunk per file on this corpus. Result count and token count comparisons should be read with this in mind

This benchmark measures **latency, footprint, and setup cost** under each tool's defaults. It does not measure ranking quality — that would require a labelled query set and is out of scope.

## Test environment

| CPU arch | `arm64` |
| Python | `3.11.14` |
| mdvs version | `mdvs 0.6.2` |
| qmd version | `qmd 2.5.2` |
| Iterations per query | 2 (+ 1 warm-up) |
| --limit | 10 |

## Corpus: `example_kb` (46 files)

### Setup (one-time build cost)

| | mdvs `build --force` | QMD `embed -f` |
|---|---|---|
| Wall time | 390 ms | 3.46 s |
| Peak RSS | 124 MB | 802 MB |
| Index on disk | 240.0 KB | 3.4 MB |
| Embedding/reranker models on disk | 59.0 MB | 2.10 GB |

### Queries

| Kind | Query | mdvs mode | `--where` clause |
|---|---|---|---|
| `broad_semantic` | _"calibration baseline"_ | `semantic` | — |
| `narrow_semantic` | _"wavelet denoising replication"_ | `semantic` | — |
| `exact_phrase` | _"SPR-A1"_ | `fulltext` | — |
| `metadata_filtered` | _"calibration"_ | `hybrid` | `status = 'completed'` |
| `vague_multiword` | _"what went wrong with the spectrometer"_ | `hybrid` | — |

### Search latency (warm, median of N)

| Kind | mdvs wall | mdvs RSS | mdvs CPU% | QMD mode | QMD wall | QMD RSS | QMD CPU% |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `broad_semantic` | 340 ms | 129 MB | 47% | `vsearch` | 810 ms | 631 MB | 87% |
| `narrow_semantic` | 335 ms | 130 MB | 45% | `vsearch` | 790 ms | 626 MB | 89% |
| `exact_phrase` | 315 ms | 53.5 MB | 44% | `search` | 155 ms | 66.7 MB | 97% |
| `metadata_filtered` | 345 ms | 133 MB | 48% | — | — | — | — |
| `vague_multiword` | 340 ms | 131 MB | 46% | `query` | 770 ms | 629 MB | 97% |

### Output token count (snippets for `--limit 10`, `tiktoken` `cl100k_base`)

Token count matters when results are piped into a downstream LLM — fewer tokens = less context spent.

| Kind | mdvs result count | mdvs tokens | QMD result count | QMD tokens |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `broad_semantic` | 10 | 1,712 | 10 | 444 |
| `narrow_semantic` | 10 | 1,373 | 8 | 467 |
| `exact_phrase` | 10 | 1,601 | 7 | 376 |
| `metadata_filtered` | 5 | 974 | — | — |
| `vague_multiword` | 10 | 1,518 | 10 | 611 |

### Notes

- _qmd_: QMD uses a global ~/.cache/qmd/index.sqlite; index_size_bytes includes any unrelated user collections
- _qmd_: skipped 'metadata_filtered': qmd has no --where equivalent
